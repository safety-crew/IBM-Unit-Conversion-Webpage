# IBM-Unit-Conversion-Webpage

In this lab, I created a simple web page Unit Converter application that converts metric units to imperial units. The page was divided into three sections, each of which did one of the following:

- Converted temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- Converted weight from Kilograms to Pounds.
- Converted distance from Kilometers to Miles.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- Creating a basic application structure using HTML Tags.
- Using <header> and <nav> tags to highlight important information at the top of an HTML page.
- Using the <article> tag to create articles within an HTML Page.
- Using the <section> tag to split the page into logical sections.
- Using <figure> and <figcaption> tags to add an image along with an appropriate caption.
- Using the <footer> tag to include information at the bottom of the page.
- Using the <aside> tag to provide information that is related to the application, but doesnâ€™t impact the application.
